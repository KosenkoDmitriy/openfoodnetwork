        <p>OFN Southern Africa is the result of a 3 way agrement between Kandu, African Conservation Trust and
          the Open Food Foundation.</p>

          Kandu Data Management Platform was developed to train, monitor and
          manage subsistence and micro scale farmers in South Africa’s rural areas
          in organic and sustainable agriculture and is in use by several NGO’s
          concerned with food security, agrarian reform and conservation in KZN.
          Several thousand small scale food producers are currently being managed
          with the Kandu system and these farmers are producing sufficient surplus
          for sale to their local communities as well as to nearby urban centres.</p>

            <p>Open Food Network (OFN) was developed by the Open Food Foundation in
              Australia which is a non-profit, registered charity established in
              October 2012, to develop and protect a commons of open source knowledge,
              code, applications and platforms for fair and sustainable food systems.</p>

              African Conservation Trust (ACT) is an established not-for-profit and
              public benefit organisation that has been operating in southern Africa
              since 2000.&nbsp;Based in KwaZulu-Natal and with a historical footprint of
              working throughout southern Africa, ACT strives for environmental
              conservation and socio-economic sustainability. ACT&nbsp;works predominantly
              in areas where conflict exists between the natural environment and human
              habitation, and work to build sustainable communities that are
              economically, environmentally, and socially healthy and resilient.</p>

            <p>The integration of Kandu with OFN&nbsp;will provide an open source
              technology platform on which&nbsp;producers of organic, ethically produced
              food and value added products will be able to self organise into
              localised value networks of collectives and food hubs in order to
              sell&nbsp;directly to the public. This collaborative commons based direct
              marketing&nbsp;strategy&nbsp;will benefit &nbsp;both producers and consumers in that
              producers will be able to earn more for their products without consumers
              paying more.&nbsp; This is achieved through;</p>
            <ul>
              <li>a strong emphasis on regional marketing and consumption which
                eliminates both the monetary and carbon cost of long distance transport ,
              </li>
              <li>the elimination of wasted produce in that produce is only shipped once ordered and paid for by the end
                user
                which in turn,
              </li>
              <li>negates the need for burdensome and energy intensive cold storage.</li>
              <li>Complete transparency in the production network which encourages
                relationship building between producers and consumers and negates the
                need for expensive branding and packaging and
              </li>
              <li>agility and flexibility in terms of distribution logistics which
                allows producers and hubs to collaborate among each other and with
                consumers to find the methodology most suited to their specific local
                conditions.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>All of the above factors combine to negate the need for middle men
              such as market agents, bulk cold storage facilities, fresh produce
              markets, supermarkets and other parasitic entities which have been
              burdening our food production and distribution system.</p>

            <p>According to UN statistics, two thirds of the food consumed on our
              planet is being produced by small scale farmers on less than a third of
              the agricultural land. OFN-SA provides a vessel for hundreds of
              thousands of marginalised, small scale farmers as well as urban food
              gardeners to collectively enter the macro economy in&nbsp;a vital and
              critical contribution to real food security. Seen against the backdrop
              of ever increasing corporate agricultural land grabs and government
              policies aligning with corporate interests in the agricultural sector,
              the establishment of a resilient, interconnected web of biophilic food
              producers has now become imperative in order to ensure the continued
              availability of organicly grown, non GM foodstuffs</p>
